# bills_extractor_2.0
My fiance is receiving big pdf file, every month, with lots of bills from mobile operator.
She has to scroll thru this file, page by page and look for where the bill for specific number is located.
Basicly this is a program that serves a specific need.
The first edition "bills_extractor_1.0" was written in 20 lines just in one file, but after that i decided to implement the 
OPEN\CLOSED PRINCIPLE so if anyone ever need to extend the program it will be easily possible.
